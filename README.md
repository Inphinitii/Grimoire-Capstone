Grimoire
=================

Grimoire is a game currently in development by Tyler Remazki and Greg Vincze as 
their capstone for their final year at Humber College under the Game Programming program. 


##Description

Grimoire is a multiplayer fighting game with a strong focus on giving the player the ability to tailor the character to their liking. 
Each page within your grimoire character will change your fight style significantly. Whether it be the type, damage and speed
of your attacks or the way you pursue your opponent, everything can be tailored to suit the needs
of the individual player.

##Engine

Grimoire is being developed using the Unity Engine for prototype purposes and may
migrate to the Paradox3D engine in the future when the source code is available and once we have
a proper understanding of the engine.
