TODO TOMORROW:

Incantations:

FIREBALL THAT GROWS THE LONGER YOU HOLD IT, BUT MOVES SLOWER.
Less you hold it = Less knockback, faster. + 1 Charge Stolen
Longer = More knockback, slower. + 2 Charges Stolen

ICE BALL THAT TRAVELS IN A COS PATTERN FORWARD. POSSIBLE FREEZE STATE?

DASH ATTACK THAT DOES DAMAGE SIMPLE AND CLEAN

IMPLEMENT: 
GAME MODES 	= COMBO KING -> Who can tilt the combo meter in their favour in the alotted time.
		= TAKE CHARGE -> Take the opponents charges through incantations.
		= DEATH MATCH -> HP AND SHIT
		
MENU SEMI WORKING?
NEED A NEW MENU MANAGER BRUV.
